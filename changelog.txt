This is a major release, incorporating many, mnay fixes along with
some major new features (Tickets, Who). This release would NOT have 
happened without the generous and patient assistance of Kitharo (from 
Land of Legends). All of us owe Kitharo a great debt for testing TrinityAdmin
on one of the world's largest servers and providing detailed feedback 
so that I could make Tickets work again. Thank you, my friend!
